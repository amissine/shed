# üë∑ Stellar Help Exchange

## The Pitch

Need a ride, but there's no Uber or Lift in the vicinity? No problem! Use Stellar Help Exchange - make a request! Selling your place and no Zillow in your area? No problem! Use Stellar Help Exchange - make an offer! Have some fresh catch to share with your neighbors? Use Stellar Help Exchange - make an offer! With Stellar Help Exchange, you can exchange help offers/requests with your neighbors as easily, as around the world. And it is SAFE.

## The Details

The project's goal is to establish a set of Distributed Autonomous Organizations, whose members (**user**s) exchange help offers/requests with each other. This set of DAOs is [Stellar](https://stellar.org/)-based. A user can be either self-paid or sponsored. To become a sponsored user, go to our (TESTNET) website [https://shed.didalik.workers.dev](https://shed.didalik.workers.dev) and accept our invite. This results in a request for the **agent** to:

- create a Stellar account for the user;
- create a trustline from this account to the project's **HEXA issuer**;
- fund the account with the initial amount of the project's asset **HEXA**.

If you already have a Stellar account and want to become a self-paid user, create a trustline from this account to the project's HEXA issuer, then buy some HEXA (either by using our utilities or by going to Stellar DEX). To create a trustline, you can go to our website and enter the secret key of your Stellar account.

When the account is funded, its holder can assist other users for more HEXA, and/or send HEXA to other accounts in exchange of help from their holders. It is also possible for the account holder to assist another user for a mere **Promise** to assist other users or herself in the near future.

When a user makes a help request, the description of the request is being broadcast to all other users who are listening for requests at the moment. Those who want to take the request, bid on the request and then wait for the requestor to accept the bid. One or more accepted bidders provide help and receive the gratitude (some amount of HEXA).

If the requestor, who already sent the gratitude to the bidder, does not get help from the bidder, the requestor opens the dispute case with the agent. If the bidder is unable to prove to the agent that help has actually been provided, the agent confiscates the gratitude from the bidder and sends it back to the requestor.

When a user makes a help offer, the description of the offer is being broadcast to all other users who are listening for offers at the moment. Those who want to take the offer, ask for the offer and then wait for the offerer to fulfill the ask. One or more fulfilled askers get the help offered and send the gratitude to the offerer.

If the asker, who already sent the gratitude to the offerer, does not get the offered help from the offerer, the asker opens the dispute case with the agent. If the offerer is unable to prove to the agent that help has actually been provided, the agent confiscates the gratitude from the offerer and sends it back to the asker.

Requestors make requests, offerers make offers; hence they are makers. Accepted bidders take requests, fulfilled askers take offers; hence they are takers. The Stellar Help Exchange user can be a maker and/or a taker. Or she can be idle.

See, for example, [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Y8Lia7gIjgM).

### What is the difference between sponsored and self-paid users?

A sponsored user does not pay Stellar fees for her transactions. The Stellar Help Exchange Agent pays them for her. The flip side of it is Agent's becoming a bottleneck under a heavy load from many users. Also, a sponsored user can use only one device (computer or smartphone) for her transactions.

A self-paid user maintains her Stellar account herself and does not require Agent's signature for all her transactions. Interactions between self-paid users are the fastest. Also, a self-paid user can use more than one device for her transactions.

### Can a sponsored user become self-paid in the future?

Yes, as soon as she has enough XLM to pay for her Stellar transactions.

### Where is my Stellar Secret Key located?

Your SSK never leaves the device (computer or smartphone) you used to become a Stellar Help Exchange user.
