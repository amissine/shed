# üë∑ Stellar Help Exchange

## The Pitch

Need help fixing your kitchen and found no bidders so far? Use Stellar Help Exchange - make a request! More work to do - keep the request and get more bids from other bidders.

Selling your business and found no buyers so far? Use Stellar Help Exchange - make an offer! Have some fresh catch to share with your neighbors? Use Stellar Help Exchange - make an offer and keep it until no more fish is left.

 With Stellar Help Exchange, you can exchange help offers/requests with your neighbors as easily as around the globe. And it is safe.

## The Details

The project's goal is to establish a set of Distributed Autonomous Organizations, whose members (**user**s) exchange help offers/requests with each other. This set of DAOs is [Stellar](https://stellar.org/)-based, so we call it Stellar Help Exchange (SHEX). To become a user, go to SHEX TESTNET website [https://shed.didalik.workers.dev](https://shed.didalik.workers.dev) and follow the prompts. This results in a request for the SHEX **agent** to:

- create a Stellar account for the user;
- create a trustline from this account to the SHEX **HEXA issuer**;
- fund the user account with the initial amount of the SHEX asset **HEXA**.

When the user is funded, she can assist other users for more HEXA, and/or send HEXA to other users in exchange of help.

When a user makes a help request, the description of the request is made available to all other users in real time. Those who want to take the request, bid on it and wait for the request maker to accept the bid. One or more accepted bidders provide help and receive the gratitude (some amount of HEXA).

If the request maker, who already sent the gratitude to the bidder, does not get help from her, the request maker opens the dispute case with the agent. If the bidder is unable to prove to the agent that help has actually been provided, the agent confiscates the gratitude from the bidder and sends it back to the request maker.

When a user makes a help offer, the description of the offer is made available to all other users in real time. Those who want to take the offer, ask for it and wait for the offer maker to fulfill the ask. One or more offer takers get the help offered and send the gratitude to the offer maker.

If the offer taker, who already sent the gratitude to the offer maker, does not get the offered help from the offer maker, the offer taker opens the dispute case with the agent. If the offer maker is unable to prove to the agent that help has actually been provided, the agent confiscates the gratitude from the offer maker and sends it back to the offer taker.

## On Using the TESTNET website

This site uses Google Maps API. Its [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) is associated with our Google billing account. On Stellar TESTNET, we restrict access to the site to eliminate the risk of being overcharged by Google. Only known IP addresses are allowed to use Google Maps API on our TESTNET site.
