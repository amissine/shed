# GDF Mandate

The Gratzio Development Foundation (GDF) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to create [Stellar](https://stellar.org/)-based Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), each of which enables one or more [Favor Exchange](https://github.com/amissine/gratzio-join/blob/main/README.md)s (FEs) of all kinds. The GDF itself is an example of such a DAO, actually. Founded in 2018, it helps sheperd and maintain the Gratzio's codebase, supports the technical and business communities around Gratzio, and provides thought leadership to regulators and other stakeholders. In all, we are a global company, more than 3 people strong, working to make Gratzio the world's Favor Exchange standard. The Gratzio technology is the GDF's means to achieve its mission.

Different FE DAOs can focus on favor exchanges of different kinds. The less ambitious and humble ones can support babysitting services for a particular neighborhood. Some can aim at providing their services worldwide. GDF focuses on supporting Gratzio's codebase development and lifecycle.
